# Basic web app to view dogs and save favorites

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To start

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Overview

The favorites are stored in the browser's local storage as a stringified array. This string is loaded from local storage and parsed when the app is launched.

The API calls to fetch dog pictures are made using axios.
